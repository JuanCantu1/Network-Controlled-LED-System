# Network Controlled LED System

# Overview
This project aims to establish a network-based control system for the LEDs on a DE1-SoC board. It leverages the functionalities of both the built-in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and the ARM processor (HPS) on the DE1-SoC. This project demonstrates a fundamental concept in computer networks, remote device control. It showcases how network communication protocols and hardware components can work together to achieve a specific action. The project highlights real-world applications like Networked Automation Systems. Similar principles are used in industrial settings where machines or devices are controlled remotely via network commands. This project will combine software and hardware to achieve remote control functionalities of LEDs on the DE1-SoC board. At the end I will have gained hands-on experience with network programming, FPGA design, and integration of hardware and software components for network-based control systems.
